- 👋 Hi, I’m @dandinkins
- 👀 I’m interested in too many things to list.  But specifically here, html, java, and eventually Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html and java.  I just started and I am a total beginner.  But this suits my mind as I see numbers, pattern recognition, and anomalies within patterns fairly easily
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning/understanding the world of coding and how best to turn it into a career
- 📫 How to reach me ...email is best: cpotl.ddd@gmail.com
